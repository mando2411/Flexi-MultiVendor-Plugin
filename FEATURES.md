- Transients caching for vendor order stats — [admin/system-settings-view.php](admin/system-settings-view.php).
- Lazy-loading of large UI modules and decoupled JS entry points — [assets/js/owner-core.js](assets/js/owner-core.js) initializes modules only when present.
- Notes on performance risks & recommended mitigations in [PROJECT_BRAIN.md](PROJECT_BRAIN.md) (avoid time() for asset versions, cache heavy queries).

9) Customization / extensibility features

10) Technical architecture highlights

- Shared helpers: [includes/helpers.php](includes/helpers.php) (vendor helper functions), image/attribute helpers under [modules/shared/](modules/shared/).
- Security model: nonces + capability checks + server-side ownership validation — references in [PROJECT_BRAIN.md](PROJECT_BRAIN.md) and enforced in key handlers ([modules/shared/ajax/manage-products-ajax.php](modules/shared/ajax/manage-products-ajax.php), [admin/system-settings.php](admin/system-settings.php)).
- Known fragile points & remediation priorities are tracked in [PROJECT_BRAIN.md](PROJECT_BRAIN.md) (recommendations: standardize nonces, centralize completeness checks, tighten upload validation).

## Why Choose WebsiteFlexi?

- Fast AJAX-first vendor workflows (modal product builder + inline edits) driven by [`loadManageProductsPage`](assets/js/owner-dashboard-theme.js) and the modal system [`wfModal`](functions.php).
- Mature WooCommerce integration: products persisted as WP posts + WC meta — handlers live in [`modules/shared/ajax/manage-products-ajax.php`](modules/shared/ajax/manage-products-ajax.php) (e.g. [`styliiiish_add_new_product`](modules/shared/ajax/manage-products-ajax.php)).
- Complete vendor lifecycle: application, KYC, status timeline and role controls in [`includes/vendor-workflow.php`](includes/vendor-workflow.php).
- Owner-grade controls and settings: admin system UI in [`admin/system-settings.php`](admin/system-settings.php) with management views in [`admin/system-settings-view.php`](admin/system-settings-view.php).
- Modular, extensible codebase: UI modules in [`modules/manage-products/manage-products.php`](modules/manage-products/manage-products.php), shared helpers in [`includes/helpers.php`](includes/helpers.php) and attribute/image helpers under `modules/shared/`.
- Security & compliance aligned with project rules: nonces, capability checks and ownership validation (see [PROJECT_BRAIN.md](PROJECT_BRAIN.md) and [SYSTEM_RULES.md](SYSTEM_RULES.md)).
- Ready-to-monetize wallet and commission flows (wallet hooks referenced in [`functions.php`](functions.php)).

## Use Cases

- Multi-vendor eCommerce marketplace — vendors list & sell fashion items; owner/manager controls platform policies and commission.
- Customer-sourced marketplace (Sell Your Dress) — customers onboard as vendors via the KYC flow in [`includes/vendor-workflow.php`](includes/vendor-workflow.php).
- Local marketplaces & pop-up shops — quick vendor onboarding and lightweight product builder (`assets/js/add-product-modal.js`, `assets/css/add-product-modal.css`).
- Order & support workflows for vendors — vendor order timeline and tracking in [`vendor-orders/vendor-orders.php`](vendor-orders/vendor-orders.php).
- Service marketplaces or resellers — flexible product attributes (`modules/shared/helpers-attributes.php`) and category/taxonomy mapping.
- Admin analytics & reconciliation — per-vendor stats and cached reports surfaced in [`admin/system-settings-view.php`](admin/system-settings-view.php).

## Product Roadmap

Short-term (next sprint)
- Standardize AJAX security: centralize nonce + capability checks into a helper in [`includes/helpers.php`](includes/helpers.php) and update handlers in [`modules/shared/ajax/manage-products-ajax.php`](modules/shared/ajax/manage-products-ajax.php). (See remediation priority in [PROJECT_BRAIN.md](PROJECT_BRAIN.md).)
- Consolidate server-side completeness checks into a single canonical function in [`modules/shared/ajax/manage-products-ajax.php`](modules/shared/ajax/manage-products-ajax.php) to remove JS/PHP divergence (`checkBeforeSave` vs PHP checks).
- Harden file uploads: enforce MIME/size checks and sanitize uploads in [`includes/vendor-workflow.php`](includes/vendor-workflow.php).

Mid-term (1–3 months)
- Wallet & payouts evolution: audit and extend wallet flows in [`functions.php`](functions.php) for scheduled payouts, refund handling and commission reporting.
- Analytics & caching: expand vendor dashboards with time-series charts and longer-lived transients in [`admin/system-settings-view.php`](admin/system-settings-view.php).
- Permission & role cleanup: formalize owner/manager/vendor separation and remove legacy global JS reliance (e.g. `window.currentProduct`).

Long-term (6+ months)
- Mobile-first dashboard rewrite: rework product builder and listing UX to a progressive SPA using the current modules (`assets/js/add-product-modal.js`, `assets/css/add-product-modal.css`) as the foundation.
- Vendor ranking & search: implement ranking signals (ratings, fulfillment rate) surfaced on [`templates/vendor-page.php`](templates/vendor-page.php).
- AI-assisted product optimization: integrate automated title/description suggestions and image QC into the add-product flow (`assets/js/add-product-modal.js` → AJAX → [`modules/shared/ajax/manage-products-ajax.php`](modules/shared/ajax/manage-products-ajax.php)).
- Multi-region & performance scale: introduce read replicas/caching and remove fragile hard-coded template/post IDs (follow [PROJECT_BRAIN.md](PROJECT_BRAIN.md) guidance).

Notes
- All roadmap items should follow the rules in [SYSTEM_RULES.md](SYSTEM_RULES.md): preserve backward compatibility, avoid heavy queries in loops, and validate security for every endpoint.
